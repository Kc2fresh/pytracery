- the "recursivePush" test doesn't work as expected (comparing outputs to the
  official test suite)
- there's no error added to the grammar's 'errors' attribute for missing
  symbols.
- the test suite needs to use an actual test harness thing (I just pasted in
  the grammar/tests from the official suite and have been eyeballing the output
  to compare differences, which is clearly not sustainable)
- python 3 compatibility
- etc.
